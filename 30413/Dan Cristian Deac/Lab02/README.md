# Lab 02

>!!! IMPORTANT - i am appending to the output file becasue i have used multiple functions to solve the problem and 
figured out that i have to give a output file as argument only at the end. This means that if a program is testing my problems, it will fail
because the results of the second test will be appended to the first.
