# Lab 03

During the course of this lab work I learned to use doubly linked lists. In the presented problem, a list of words had to be arranged alfabetically, and traversed both from the beginning to the end and vice versa.
For this I used a doubly linked list. Every node stored a string and the number of times that string appeared in the text. Then I built a function that sorts
the list using a bubble sort algorithm. Finally, once the data had been sorted, I wrote a loop that traverses the list first to last and then another loop
that traverses last to first. Solving this problem made me realize just how useful this data structure can be.
