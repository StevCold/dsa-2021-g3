# Lab 06

> During this lab I learned how to implement hash tables. I built the functions necessary for creating a node within the table, and for deleting
and finding a node after a given key, using the supplied code. For the problem that had to be solved, I assumed that each given name will have as its
first letter a capital letter, and using that I wrote the hash function which positions every name on the index that corresponds with the place
of that letter in the alphabet, e.g A would have index 1 and Z 26. After that, every other name that is added that has the same initial as a previously
added name will be chained, in the order of insertion, into the hash table.
