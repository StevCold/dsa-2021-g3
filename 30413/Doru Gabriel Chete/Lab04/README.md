# Lab 04

> During this lab work I learned to build binary trees and traverse them in different ways. First I built the functions used to build the tree
and then the necessary functions to traverse it in the three presented ways: inorder, preorder and postorder. I then built a function to interchange the left and
right subtrees of a given node, a function to determine the height of a binary tree and a function to calculate the number of leaves of a binary tree. I learned a lot
about operating on this data structure, as well as some of the advantages of using it.
