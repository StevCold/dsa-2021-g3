# Lab 07

> In this lab I learned about graphs, and more about how they can be represented and implemented. I learned about the trade offs one has to make
when choosing a type of implementation and when one type or the other can be more useful or more efficient. I also learned more about the different
kinds of traversals as well as some algorithms and how they work when implemented in C.
