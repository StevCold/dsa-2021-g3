# Lab 08

> During the course of thise lab I learned about greedy algorithms. I found out that they are suited for some situations and less so for other situations
As in a lot of situations, there are trade offs between resources and time. To solve the problem, I wrote functions that compute the greatest
common divisor and the least common multiple and use them to apply the presented method from the lab. The fraction is flipped and I use the ceil function, 
and so on, until we only have normal fractions.
