# Lab 05

> During the course of this lab I learned how to use binary search trees. I wrote the supplied code for the functions that operate on the BST and I
tested them. I wrote a function for inserting, finding, deleting a node, then for finding the minimum and maximum node, then for traversing the BST.
For this implementation it's worth noting there is actually no function to create the BST. We just keep track of a pointer "currrentRoot" that points
to the root of the tree or is null in case the tree is empty. I used this pointer as a paramater in the calls to all the functions that operate on the BST.
Also, when the tree is traversed, the keys of the nodes will just be written on a separate line, in order. While I was testing the different functions
it became very obvious that this is a very useful and practical data strucutre that can be used in a lot of situations.
