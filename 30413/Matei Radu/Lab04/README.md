## Solved problem 4.2

### Subproblem 4.2.1 'Switch Subtrees'

	Switching the subtrees is trivial.
	Switching the left and right pointers of the specified node (while using an auxilliary variable) worked.
	
### Subproblem 4.2.2 'Tree height'

	This problem required a simple recursive implemetiation that counts the number of nodes on possible paths and compares them.

### Subproblem 4.2.3 'Number of Leaves'

	Counts the nodes whose children are both NULL recursively. Not much more to say...
