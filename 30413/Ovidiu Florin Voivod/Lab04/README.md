# Lab 04

> At this lab I've learned:
							-how complexity of a programm works, and how to determine it.
							-how binary trees are implemented and how to work with them and on them.
							-how to write recursive functions on binary trees
							-traversals of a binary trees

For the Mandatory Assignment I had to determine the number of leaves and the height of a binary tree, and also to swap the subgraphs of a given node.
