# Lab 02
For the first problem we had some trucks which represent nodes in a SLL. The road and garage were 2 different lists. 
Actually the garage was a stack which is a special SLL which works according to LIFO mode and the road was a SLL with insertion at the beginning.

For the second problem, the garage was presented as a queue now, which is a special list wich works according to FIFO mode, and the road was a list with the same properties as in 1st problem.

Solving this 2 mandatory problems I have learned how to use basic functions wich can be operated on SLLs.
