# Lab 03

In this lab I've learned how to work with Doubly Linked Lists. The mandatory problem had a one-line text in which every word was taken as a node.
I had to count the frequency of every word and make a list with every unique one followed by it's frequency.
The output contained the words (nodes of the list) in ascending and descending order.
