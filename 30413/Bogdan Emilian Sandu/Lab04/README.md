# Lab 04

> Learned about trees, binary trees, tree traversals, time complexity of an algorithm.
Managed to solve the mandatory assignment.
Solved the extra assignment:
*made use of a global variable in order to find the manager
*developed a function called highestTenure which helped me find out the sum of a subtree and the number of its nodes
*developed a function called highestTenureM which goes from node to node and calculates the sum and nr of nodes of the subtree (it excludes leaves) using highestTenure
*developed a function called highestTenureFinal which condenses all the prev functions into 1 and makes use of a global variable to find the manager
Tried to make it work in n time but didnt manage.
