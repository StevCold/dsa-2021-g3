# Lab 04

During the lab i've learned about:
-about the complexity of a programm, the examples were very useful for actually understanding it
-binary trees: -some basic concepts and recursive functions (such as nb of leaves)
			   -traversals of a binary tree (again, the examples were very helpful)
			   
For the assignment, i had to understand the given code and use it in order to print the number of leaves of a given
tree, its height and also be able to interchange the left and right child of a node, afterwards printing the new tree
in all 3 ways (preorder, inorder and postorder).
