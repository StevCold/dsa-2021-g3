# Lab 05

During the lab I learned the basic functions when working with binary search trees. I have also learned
how to write my code in such a way that it is easier for others to read and understand it.
For the assignment, I found that it was important to place the root of the tree in the correct place. After I 
handled that, the functions worked properly.
