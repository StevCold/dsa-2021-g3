# Lab 06

During the lab, we have studied some basic things about hash tables, why they are efficient and different ways of
creating them, working on examples so that we got a better understanding of the concept.

The task for this week also said that we were supposed to explain how we read the input and why it works:
-i used the fact that the commands are on different lines. this way, i read the file character by character and did the 
appropriate operations when i dumped upon an enter. The first character of the resulting string represented the operation
which had to be done, the rest being the full name of the student. After knowing this information, the problem reduced to 
using the previously defined functions in the right way.
