# Lab 08

Last week we talked about greedy algorithms. One example is Prim's algorithm, which we've seen how it works
implemented on the problem of dividing a sum of money into paper bills, taking into account the fact that we
should use as few paper bills as possible.

The assignment was about writing a vulgar fraction into something like this: 1/x + 1/y + ...
In the implementation, the important detail was using a ceil function on a certain fraction. What was also needed
to be taken into account were the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of numbers, in order to actually 
make the problem work.
