# Lab 02 Tat Teodora

> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.

Firstly we observe that the function R is for creating the list for the road (in problem 1
the road is a simple linked list- I used for it the function for creating new nodes in the structure I made
and a function for insertion at the end of the list, while in the second problem I observed that the road is
a queue and used the same creation mode) 
E is the function that takes out the node from the list of the road and puts it in the garage which I observed
is a stack - for this function I checked first if the truck/node exists and if so then deleted the node from the
 list for the road and added it on the stack for the garage, if not print that it doesn t exists
 X is for seaching the top element of the stack of the garage coresponds with the given element
 if so, print that is exists, if not, print a certain mesage if it s in the stack but not at the top or
 if it s not it prints that it doesn t exists at all
 S prints the elements from the garage(the list or the queue) or from the stack of the garage
