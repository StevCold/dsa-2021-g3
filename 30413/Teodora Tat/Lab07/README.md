# Lab 07

In this lab I remembered what a graph means, what a complete graph looks like, how does a graph look, with all the vertices and edges, how to implement a graph in C
I learned about directed and undirected graphs, how a complete graph looks, what a connected graph means and what a strongly connected graph means (a graph where you have
a path from each vertex to any other vertex), what a path means 
I also learned about the ways to implement and represent a graph: through the adjacency matrix or through an adjacency list
Then I learned how to implement the DFS and BFS methods in C, how they work and how to apply them
