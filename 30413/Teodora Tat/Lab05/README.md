# Lab 05
Firsty I created some functions to create the tree, then created the printing functions  (inorder, preorder and postorder) then a function to insert a node (for creating the tree)
Then 2 functions, one for finding the minimum and one for finding the maximum, then a function for deleting a node (I used the examples from the lab to understand how to do it)
Then I created a function for applying every command I have to do (i for insertind a letter, d for deleting a node, f for finding a node, trasversals using the letter t, 
respectevely p, P and i) and gm for finding the minimum, gM for finding the maximum
