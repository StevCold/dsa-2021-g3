# Lab 06
Firstly I created the hash table with the help of a list, then I created the requested functions from the problem:
-one for finding a specific name in the table
-one for inserting a given name in the table (I also added a message for errors)
-one for deleting a certain name
-and one function for printing the hash table
In main I also added the requested messages (the one for the finding function, for a letter that has no representative function we also added a message)
