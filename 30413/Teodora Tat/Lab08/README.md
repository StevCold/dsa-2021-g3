# Lab 08
I did only a simple function (I`m not sure if the program is optimal but I tried it on different values and it works). In the function I simply used a while in which I used
a variable i whose value starts from 2 (we start with the biggest unit fraction 1/2, the variable i goes up in the while so that we can use all the unit fractions), and then 
I compared the unit fraction with the given fraction, if the unit fraction is smaller than we print it and substract it from the number, otherwise the value i increases.
The while stops when we have no value left.
