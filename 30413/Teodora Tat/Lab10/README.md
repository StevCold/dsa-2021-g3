# Lab 10
In this lab I learned about dinamic programming. I saw first how to solve the Fibonacci array problem with dinamic programming, then I received a task to solve the minimum path in a matrix.
In the problem I calculated at every position the minimum path until that position : firstly I created a minimum function which I used for finding the smallest neighbour of the position I am at to help adding it to the value of that position so that I will have the shortest path (in the function I calculated separately the minimum path for the first line and column).
