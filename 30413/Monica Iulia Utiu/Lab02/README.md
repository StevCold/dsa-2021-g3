# Lab 02

> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.

I have considered that the problem was implying a queue road and a queue garage (with LIFO). 
I've created and adapted the functions needed for getting trucks on the road, off the road and into the garage and out of the garage, including the printing functions.
Unfortunately, i can't get my date.in and date.out files to link to the project and thus, i cannot verify its correctness.
I will try to fix this, but I don't have enough time until the deadline, so this is what I've done so far.
