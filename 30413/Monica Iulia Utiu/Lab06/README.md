# Lab 06

> Didnt do my homework lab this week, i wont give any excuses cus realistically looking back i should've done it in advance.
Of course, I will do it at least until the next lab homework deadline, but I'll try to do it until the end of tomorrow's day (after Lab07).
Excuse me and thank you in advance.
