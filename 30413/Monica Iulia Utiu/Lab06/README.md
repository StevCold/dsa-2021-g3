# Lab 06

> Didnt do my homework lab this week, i wont give any excuses cus realistically looking back i should've done it in advance.
Of course, I will do it at least until the next lab homework deadline, but I'll try to do it until the end of tomorrow's day (after Lab07).
Excuse me and thank you in advance.

>>>Update: Did it, had a few problems with the names but i left them as such in the end cus if i made them strings without tab for some reason my output file became empty.
