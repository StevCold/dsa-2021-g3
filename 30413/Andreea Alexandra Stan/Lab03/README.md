# Lab 3

> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.
	-During this lab I read and studies the laboratory guide and learned about circular singly
linked lists and doubly linked lists.
	-Then i started the second problem from the mandatory assignments category
	-For solving this assignment I had to read a text from a file fiven as a command line argument.
Each word was placed in a doubly linked list, sorted in alphabetical ascending order, then counted
Every word and the number of repetitions was placed in an output file,first in ascending order,
then descending
