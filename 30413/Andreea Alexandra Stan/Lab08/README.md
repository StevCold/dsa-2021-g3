> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.
During this lab we learned about Greedy algorithms, then we talked about some examples: Prim's algorithm the one about the least amount of paper bills.

To solve the assignment I used the method discussed during the lab: we calculate the ceil of the fraction, substract from the given fraction 1/ceil then repeat the process for the obtained fraction.
