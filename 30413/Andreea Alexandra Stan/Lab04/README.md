# Lab 4

> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.

-During this lab we first discussed about Big O, saw some examples and calculated the runtime of some code examples
- Then we discussed about trees, especially the binary trees. I learned about the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder traversals of trees. 
- Lastly, we discussed the extra assignments from the previous lab and searched for the most efficient solution
-After that i started doing the mandatory and extra assignments

 For 4.2 mandatory assignment:
-i interchanged the left and the right subtree i swapped every root from the left subtree with its corespondent on the right subtree. (in main i checked by swapping the subtrees of the root. i added a function to find a specific node, given by its id, then swap its subtrees)
 
-for calculating the height i calculated the maximum path of every left subtree and of every right subtree and chose each time the maximum one.

-to calculate the number of leafs: recursive function with which we add 1 everytime we reach a leave
