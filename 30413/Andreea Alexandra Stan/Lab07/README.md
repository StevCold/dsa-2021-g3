# Lab 7

> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.
During this Lab I learned about graphs, methods of representations and their possible traversals.
We also disscused about the partial exam and how to send our solutions during the exam.

To solve the extra problem I used a directed graph and represented it with an adjacency matrix (there is an arc from x to y if robot x is faster than robot y). Then I sorted every robot by its "internal degree" (by how many robots are faster than him).
