# Lab 5

> learned about binary search trees, main operations for bst
also learned how to write intelligible code so that other programmers can read it

solved mandatory 5.2 using the code learned during lab

extra problem: solved directly without using stack, i hope it's alright
- first i observe that the operators are only on positions that represent powers of 2
- also, the operands are always leafs
*  -  1.05  +  -55  22  10.3
1  2   3    4   5   6     7

algorithm:
- create binary tree with operators recursively, when an operand is met stop there with that branch, operand remains leaf
