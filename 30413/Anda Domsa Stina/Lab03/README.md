# Lab 3
In this lab I learned about circular linked lists and doubly linked lists and I solved a problem using them.
Problem 3.2: I first read the text from the file in.txt and I treated the words as nodes and inserted them in a doubly linked list, sorting them at the same time ( for this I compared the new words with the ones already existing in the list), and then I printed them, at first in ascending order, and then in descending order.
