# Lab 4

> In this lab I first learned about algorithm complexity and then about binary trees.
I solved the mandatory problem for this Lab(4.2). 
First I had to interchange the subtrees of a node and I did it by using an auxiliary node(aux).
Then, I had to compute the height of the binary tree and I used a recursive function(H), in which I compared the heights of each node's children, chose maximum and added 1.
Lastly, I needed to count the number of leaves which I also did  by using a recursive function and a node p: if p NULL return 0, if p has only NULL children p is a leaf so return 1, else, return leaves(left)+leaves(right).
