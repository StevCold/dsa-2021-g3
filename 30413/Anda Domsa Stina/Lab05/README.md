# Lab 5

> In this lab we talk a lttle about Binary search trees and I solved the mandatory problem (5.2).
Problem 5.2: This problem implied the demonstration of the BST operations in a tree which contains as keys the uppercase letters of the Roman alphabet.
First i created the BST and then i had to make a function to insert a node, then one to delete a node, one to display the nodes in different orders and one to calculate the minimum and maximum node in the BTS.
