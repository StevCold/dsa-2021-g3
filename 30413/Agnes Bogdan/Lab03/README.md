# Lab 03

> First i read the input text from a file, character by character, after that i added a plus " "
to the string. Then i started to choose the words one by one and creating nodes with each one of them.
after this i inserted every node to make a doubly linked list. by using the search function i
determined that how many times does a word appear in the input text.
