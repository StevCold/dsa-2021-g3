# Lab 3

> 	In this lab we learned about Doubly Linked Lists.
>	On the problem 3.2 we had to make a program that would take words and put them in acending order in a doubly linked list, including the number of appearances of each one.
The function newnode creates a new node that stores a word, New_DLL creates a new list, insert makes sure that the nodes would get in the correct order eventually and
ascendiingPrinting and descendingPrinting print the list in reverse order to each other by beginning with the opposite "heads" of the list and going either from left to right(ascending),
or from right to left(descending).
