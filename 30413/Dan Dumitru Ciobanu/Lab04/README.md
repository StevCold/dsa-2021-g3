	Lab 04

> In this lab we learned about complexities, which was really interesting, also we studied binary trees: how to traverse one, find the height of it, number of leaves.
For the problem 4.2 I've used some ideas from the lab codes. I modified a little the functions that make the traversals, the swap function makes sure that we can rotate the children
of nodes, the function searchByKey returns a node that we look for by the key(id), the function nrOfLeaves recusevely returns 1 for a leave found, then it adds everything and we get
the result.
