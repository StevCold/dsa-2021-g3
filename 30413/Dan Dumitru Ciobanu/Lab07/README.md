 Lab 7
 
 In this lab, we have learned about graph representations: adjacency matrix and adjacency list and about the benefits of each one. Also we have learned about graph traversals: 
 breadth first search and depth first search and the way to implement each one of them. Also the lab tells us about the way to find the shortest paths from a single vertex(Dijkstra).
