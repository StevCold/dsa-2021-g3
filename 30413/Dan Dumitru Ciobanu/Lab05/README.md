Lab05

In this lab we learnead about Binary Search Trees and how to make different operations on them such as inserting a new node, deleting an existing one, finding nodes by a key and many others.
As for the mandatory problem, I modified a bit the code within the lab 'paper', but unfortunately I get some 'conflicting type' errors for almost all the functions. I will probably try to make the problem again
with different ideas for myself, due to the lack of time to reupload it on git on time.
