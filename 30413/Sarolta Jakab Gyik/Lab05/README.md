# Lab 5

> In the binary search tree the program can insert, delete a node, find the maximum or minimum node, in this case the first
or last letter on the alphabet present in the tree, or it can also do preorder, inorder and postorder traversals. In the input
file all these operations are specifies with a single character. The program runs until the end of all instructions. If the operation
specified is min or max of the tree, then we call these functions. If not, the program reads the key specified after the operation
in the pointer key and it does the operation specified afterwards.
To find the minimum of the binary search tree we call a recursive function until we reach the left most node of the tree. That
will be the minimum. To find the maximum we do the same on the right branch. Thus we receive the maximum of the tree.
