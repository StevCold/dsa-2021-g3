# Lab 02

> In the exercise my convertion from string to integer is incorrect. It works for the first few examples but for 9 it converts it to 90
and from then on it also calculates the id variables, thus enters the if, when it really shouldn't.
Also when I tried to run the program in the control panel it makes an executable file but something goes incorrectly and it doesn't show anything
just closes in a brief second. If you could help with that...
