**EGYPTIAN FRACTION PROBLEM - using GREEDY algorithm**
> After I read the vulgar fraction from a file, I called the egyptianFraction() function for which I used a Greedy algorithm
> For this I had to calculate the ceil of the inverse fraction, which would be the denominator of an egyptian fraction, so this egyptian fraction could be printed
> Then I called recursively the function with some new parameters, for the new fraction = old fraction - 1/ceil
> The algorithm will stop when the fraction for which our function will be called can already be written as an egyptian fraction.
> The algorithm is of Greedy type because we always take first the biggest possible fraction.
