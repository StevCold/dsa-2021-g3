# Lab 03

	In this laboratory, I expanded my knowledge about linked lists. We started by representing the allocation
of memory for arrays, which underlines the importance of linked lists. Then, we continued with the lab. I went through the theory
about circular lists and doubly-linked lists. I read the code and tried to implement it myself.After that, I started the mandatory problem.
