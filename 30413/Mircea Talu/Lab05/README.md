# Lab 5

	In this lab we talked about binary search trees. We learned their defining properties of the nodes of a binary search tree.
	Then, we started working on the mandatory assignment. In the second hour of the lab we had a review session of our colleague 
	Teodora, where we learned about coding style and the international conventions of code-writing.
