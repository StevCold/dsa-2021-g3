# Lab 4

	We started by reviewing the problems from Lab03 and discussing them. Then, the teacher explained to us the theory about trees
	and the different ways in which they can be traversed. We wrote more code and had some exercises during the lab.
	After that, we started working on the mandatory assignments.
