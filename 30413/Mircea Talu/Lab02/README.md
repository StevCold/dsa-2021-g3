# Lab 2

I created a GitHub account, where I joined the https://github.com/bogdansalau/dsa-2021-g3 repository.
I watched the tutorials on how to master the basics of git and I managed to recreate them. 
The first step was downloading Git and Creating a Bash Git. Then, I tried the commands " git clone <...> ",
" git status ", " git add . ", " git commit -m <...> "
