# Lab 5

> I learned about binary search trees and how to implement them myself
> Also learned how to write code properly, to make it more readable
> We also did a code analasys, or something like that, can't remember the name exactly
> I also added the extra problem, I want to say this in advance, the code at the first sight looks simillar to my brother's,
but I just followed an algorithm from a site, nothing fancy ( I wrote this because I had problems in the first semester with this
and I don't want to happen again)
