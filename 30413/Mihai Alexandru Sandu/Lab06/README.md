# Lab 06

> In this lab I learned about hash tables, how they work, how to handle collisions, about everything
> We also solved an ex extra assignment and did some extra problems that were very interesting
> I solved the mandatory problem, most of the functions were preatty much straight forward,
and the lab explained the code, so there was no problem with it.
