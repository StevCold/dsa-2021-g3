# Lab 3

> At this lab, I learned how circular singly linked lists, and how to implement them as arays(and of course all the operations on them)
> I also learned about doubly linked lists, how to implement one and I learned operations on them.
> I also found out to be careful about the code that is written in the lab documentation.
>I also fully understood those conceps and can implement them from the top of my head, which 1 month ago I found it difficult.
