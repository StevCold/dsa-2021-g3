# Lab 07

> In this lab we talked about graphs, learned how to implement them in 3 different ways
> Also learned how 2 traversals work, BFS and DFS
> learned how to implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
>P.S i will send the extra assigment after the deadline with like 20 minutes, I hope it still counts :(
