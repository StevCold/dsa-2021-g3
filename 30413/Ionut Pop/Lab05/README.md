# Lab 5

-problem 5.2:
	-the commands are executed as they are read from the given file
	-the command and parameter are extracted from each line read
						  ("command", "key")
	-I used "input" and "output" as I/O files but I have written in comments 
	 the coresponding code for command-written file names
