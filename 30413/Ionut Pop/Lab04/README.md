# Lab 4

learned how to implement binary trees

In the mandatory problem: 
	-for interchanging the subtrees of a given tree I first searched the node in 	     the tree by travesing it in preorder, than I swapped two nodes that were
	 pointed from that node (node->left, node->right)
	-for tree height the function returns the maximum lenght chain of nodes
	 starting from the root
	-for counting the leaves the function adds 1 for all the nodes that don't
	 have children nodes
